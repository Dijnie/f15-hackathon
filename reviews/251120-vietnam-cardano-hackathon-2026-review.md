## Impact Review (24/35) - 3 STARS (ACCEPTABLE)

### Strengths

**1. Compelling Market Opportunity**
- Vietnam is #5 global crypto market (21.2M users) - validated data
- Zero Cardano hackathons vs $4.8M+ competitor investments (Solana, Aptos, VietBUIDL) - strong competitive narrative
- Regulatory timing window (Jan 2026 blockchain law) creates genuine first-mover advantage
- 530K engineers + 50K annual IT graduates = large untapped talent pool

**2. Measurable KPIs**
- Clear on-chain metrics (₳50K+ transaction volume, wallet tracking)
- Quantified targets (150-300 participants, 50+ projects, 5-10 retained teams)
- Realistic vs comparable proposals (Berlin ₳200K/120 devs, East Africa ₳50K/77 participants)
- Post-event tracking methodology (GitHub commits, Fund16 submissions)

**3. Multi-Phase Value Creation**
- Pre-training bootcamp creates Vietnamese educational content (benefits 1000s beyond event)
- 3-month incubation vs typical one-off hackathons (addresses retention problem)
- Fund16 pipeline (2-3 proposals) = ecosystem ROI multiplier
- Regional expansion potential (Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia proof-of-concept)

**4. Enterprise Alignment**
- Real business challenges (supply chain, payments, RWA tokenization)
- Aligns with Vietnam's National Blockchain Strategy + new crypto law
- Cardano's formal verification narrative fits Vietnamese "stability-first" regulatory approach

### Weaknesses

**1. Over-Optimistic Impact Projections**
- 150-300 participants is HUGE range (100% variance) - suggests lack of planning precision
- "50+ projects" from first-time Cardano event in market with "scarce" developers - ambitious vs reality
- Claims "5-10 teams continue development" but industry standard <3% hackathon retention
- ₳50K+ on-chain volume from hackathon projects within 6 months - no precedent cited

**2. Vague Enterprise Commitments**
- "2-3 enterprise pilots" mentioned repeatedly but NO CONFIRMED PARTNERS
- All enterprise sections say "LOIs in progress" - proposal submitted without actual commitments
- Companies named (FPT Software, VNPay, Momo) but NO evidence of engagement
- High risk these "challenge tracks" become generic DeFi competitions

**3. Weak Community Foundation**
- Proposal assumes Vietnamese Cardano community exists, but evidence shows it's minimal
- "Vietnamese Cardano Discord/Telegram" mentioned but no member count or engagement metrics
- How do you recruit 150-300 devs to an ecosystem with ~zero local presence?
- Marketing assumes "build it and they will come" - high execution risk

**4. Regional Expansion Overreach**
- "SEA expansion proof" repeatedly claimed but 20% non-Vietnam participation is speculative
- No partnerships with Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia organizations
- Remote participation historically gets 10-20% of in-person engagement
- Trying to do too much: Vietnam + 4-week training + incubation + regional expansion in 5 months

**5. Impact Measurement Issues**
- "₳50K+ transaction volume" - what if projects are testnet-only? What if DApps get zero organic users?
- "2-3 Fund16 proposals submitted" ≠ proposals funded or quality
- "10+ media articles" - Vietnamese tech media coverage ≠ ecosystem impact
- Conflates activity metrics (registrations) with impact metrics (sustained contribution)

### Improvement Recommendations

1. **Narrow target range**: Commit to realistic 100-150 participants (not 150-300). Show marketing plan to achieve this.
2. **Prove enterprise demand**: Get 1-2 signed LOIs BEFORE proposal submission. Name specific challenges.
3. **Focus geography**: Vietnam-only for v1. Prove local success before SEA expansion claims.
4. **Demonstrate community**: Show existing Vietnamese Cardano Telegram/Discord size. If <100 members, recalibrate.
5. **Quality over quantity**: 30 quality projects > 50+ aspirational. High retention = realistic retention.

## Feasibility Review (18/35) - 2.5 STARS (POOR-ACCEPTABLE)

### Strengths

**1. Benchmarking Rigor**
- Cites comparable funded proposals (BUTC ₳68K, Berlin ₳200K, East Africa ₳50K)
- Timeline (5 months) aligns with successful hackathon precedents
- Budget percentages (venue 61.7%, prizes 21.7%) match industry standards
- Vietnam cost efficiency argument valid (50-70% cheaper than Europe)

**2. Risk Identification**
- 6+ risks identified with mitigation strategies (low participation, budget overrun, ADA volatility, etc.)
- Acknowledges "medium" likelihood on participation and enterprise partner risks
- ADA price hedge strategy (convert 80% to stablecoin) shows financial awareness

**3. Multi-Sig & Transparency**
- 2-of-3 multisig wallet (Lead + Technical + Independent member)
- Public Google Sheets budget tracking
- Milestone-based disbursement (not lump sum)
- On-chain transaction audit trail

### Weaknesses (CRITICAL - PROPOSAL-KILLING ISSUES)

**1. ZERO VERIFIED TEAM CREDENTIALS** 🚨
- Every team member field says "[NAME TO BE PROVIDED]"
- No LinkedIn profiles attached (required per proposal guidelines)
- No prior event organization experience demonstrated
- No Plutus/Aiken code repos shown for "Cardano Technical Lead"
- **This is AUTOMATIC LOW FEASIBILITY SCORE** - community cannot assess capability

**2. NO PROOF OF VENUE AVAILABILITY** 🚨
- "Quotes obtained" but NO venue named or contract shown
- "300-person capacity confirmed [Venue name] available [Date range]" - PLACEHOLDERS NOT FILLED
- Proposal requests ₳20K for venue but provides zero evidence venue is bookable
- High risk of "scrambling to find venue after funding approved"

**3. NO CONFIRMED UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS** 🚨
- "HCMC University of Technology [contact name] confirmed recruitment support" - PLACEHOLDER
- "Letters of support attached" - NOT ATTACHED
- Universities critical for participant recruitment but zero evidence of engagement
- Weakens entire 150-300 participant projection

**4. NO ENTERPRISE COMMITMENTS** 🚨
- "Enterprise LOIs attached" - NOT ATTACHED
- "(FPT Software, VNPay, Momo - LOIs in progress)" - "in progress" = not secured
- Cannot score feasibility HIGH when core value prop (enterprise challenges) unconfirmed
- Risk: Event becomes generic "build a DApp" competition

**5. UNVALIDATED BUDGET NUMBERS**
- "Budget spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[TO BE PROVIDED]" - NO SPREADSHEET
- ₳20K venue cost = ~$10K USD - is this real quote or estimate?
- ₳8K catering (150-300 participants × 3 days) - 100% variance in participant count = budget risk
- ₳2K "travel support" for 10-20 international participants - insufficient (airfare alone $200-500)

**6. "TO BE PROVIDED" EPIDEMIC**
- 20+ instances of "[TO BE PROVIDED]", "[NAME]", "[URL]", placeholders
- Proposal reads like TEMPLATE, not submission-ready document
- Suggests rushed preparation or lack of groundwork

**7. UNPROVEN TECHNICAL CAPABILITY**
- Who designs Vietnamese Plutus/Aiken curriculum? No CV shown.
- Who judges hackathon submissions? "10-15 judges" but none identified.
- Who mentors incubation teams? "5-10 mentors" - where do they come from in market with "scarce" Cardano devs?

**8. TIMELINE COMPRESSION RISK**
- Month 1: "Planning, venue, partnerships, marketing launch" - this is 4-6 weeks of work BEFORE you start
- If funded Jan 2026, need to book venue, secure enterprises, finalize curriculum, launch marketing simultaneously
- 4-week bootcamp (Months 2-3) requires curriculum ready Day 1 - proposal shows none

### Improvement Recommendations (MANDATORY BEFORE SUBMISSION)

1. **FILL IN ALL TEAM DETAILS**: Real names, LinkedIn URLs, prior event portfolios, Cardano work examples. NO PLACEHOLDERS.
2. **ATTACH VENUE QUOTE**: PDF quote from named venue (Dreamplex, CirCO, etc.) with dates, capacity, cost. Booking deposit receipt if available.
3. **SHOW UNIVERSITY COMMITMENTS**: Email from CS department chair confirming recruitment support. Letter of partnership.
4. **GET 1-2 ENTERPRISE LOIs**: Signed letters from companies committing to provide challenge tracks or pilot opportunities.
5. **PUBLISH DETAILED BUDGET**: Google Sheets with line-item costs, vendor quotes, market rate comparisons (make public).
6. **DEMONSTRATE CARDANO EXPERTISE**: Link GitHub repos of Plutus/Aiken projects from technical lead. Show teaching experience.
7. **PROVIDE PROOF OF LIFE**: Video introduction from team members, public LinkedIn profiles updated with "Catalyst proposer" role.
8. **SHOW EXISTING COMMUNITY**: Vietnamese Cardano Telegram/Discord member count, engagement metrics (if <50 members, major red flag).

**CURRENT STATE**: This proposal is NOT ready for funding approval. Reads like 70% complete draft.

## Value for Money Review (20/30) - 3 STARS (ACCEPTABLE)

### Strengths

**1. Competitive Cost Efficiency**
- ₳200-400 per developer vs Berlin ₳1,666 (75% cost reduction)
- Vietnam purchasing power advantage (₳60K = ₳100-120K European equivalent)
- ₳1,200 per project vs Berlin ₳6,666 (80% improvement)
- Vietnamese labor rates ($20-40/hr vs $50-100 Western) = valid cost arbitrage

**2. Budget Transparency Framework**
- Itemized breakdown (venue, prizes, marketing, ops, incubation)
- Percentages disclosed (61.7% venue, 21.7% prizes, etc.)
- Multi-sig + public tracking = good fund management design
- Milestone-based disbursement reduces misuse risk

**3. Multi-Component Value**
- Not just 3-day event: Pre-training (4 weeks) + hackathon (3 days) + incubation (3 months)
- Vietnamese content repository = public good (benefits 1000s)
- 2-3 Fund16 proposals = potential ₳60-180K additional ecosystem funding unlocked
- Enterprise pilots = gateway to Asian market adoption

**4. ROI Logic**
- If 10% participants (15-30 devs) stay active 2+ years → ₳1.5M-6M ecosystem value
- If 1 enterprise pilot scales → ₳500K-5M adoption value
- Fund16 pipeline → 1-3x ROI on incubation alone
- Calculations directionally sound (even if optimistic)

### Weaknesses

**1. UPPER-BOUND REQUEST WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION**
- ₳60K is maximum Cardano Open category limit (₳15K-₳60K)
- Proposal argues "market size + competitive parity" justify upper bound
- BUT: First-time team, unproven Vietnamese Cardano community, zero confirmed partners = HIGH RISK
- Comparable: East Africa ₳50K (77 participants) delivered; why should untested team get 20% more?

**2. BUDGET LACKS GRANULARITY**
- ₳20K venue = single line item. Need: 3-day rental breakdown, AV costs, WiFi, insurance separately.
- ₳8K catering = "Vietnamese market rates $8-12/person/day" - but 150 vs 300 participants = ₳4K variance
- ₳5K marketing = "8-week campaign, 100K impressions" - no CPM math shown
- ₳13K prize pool = reasonable, but distribution (₳5K/3K/2K/1K×4) means only 7 teams get paid

**3. QUESTIONABLE LINE ITEMS**
- ₳2K "travel support" for 10-20 international participants = $100-200 each (insufficient for flights)
- ₳1K "influencer partnerships" - Vietnamese tech YouTubers charge ₳1K for promotion? Needs validation.
- ₳800 "registration platform" - Devpost Pro is $999/year (~₳2K ADA). Math doesn't add up.
- ₳1K "mentor stipends" for 5-10 mentors × 8 sessions = $3-6 per session (insultingly low)

**4. NO ALTERNATIVE FUNDING PLAN**
- Proposal mentions "if ₳40K funded, scale down" but doesn't specify HOW
- What gets cut? Prizes? Participants? Incubation?
- No co-funding sources mentioned (sponsors, university in-kind support, etc.)
- Risk: If partially funded, team delivers subpar event and blames "insufficient budget"

**5. HIDDEN COSTS IGNORED**
- Team time/salary = ₳0. Proposal assumes volunteer labor for 5 months. Realistic?
- Currency conversion fees = ₳0. ADA → USD → VND = 2-5% loss not budgeted.
- Contingency = ₳500 (0.8% of budget). Industry standard 10-15%. Underfunded.
- Post-event community operations (Discord moderation, monthly meetups beyond Month 5) = ₳0. Sustainability?

**6. VALUE PROJECTION OPTIMISM**
- "₳1.5M-6M ecosystem value from 15-30 developers" - ₳100K-200K per developer lifetime value is VERY HIGH
- "₳500K-5M enterprise adoption" from 1 pilot - where does this number come from?
- "2-3 Fund16 proposals = ₳60K-180K unlocked" - assumes proposals funded at ₳30K-60K each (upper range)
- Calculations feel "work backwards from desired ROI" vs evidence-based

**7. COMPARATIVE WEAKNESS VS COMPETITORS**
- VietBUIDL $4M budget attracts top Vietnamese developers with life-changing prizes
- Aptos $400K investment = 13x Cardano offer. Vietnamese devs will compare.
- ₳13K prize pool ($6,500 total) split 7 ways = ₳1,857 winner (~$928). Competitive?
- Risk: Best developers go to higher-paying hackathons, Cardano gets "leftovers"

### Improvement Recommendations

1. **JUSTIFY ₳60K REQUEST**: Explain why untested team deserves upper-bound vs. requesting ₳40-50K for proven execution first.
2. **DETAILED BUDGET SPREADSHEET**: Line-item every expense with vendor quotes, quantities, unit costs. Make public.
3. **SCENARIO PLANNING**: Show what ₳40K, ₳50K, ₳60K versions deliver. Let community choose risk level.
4. **REALISTIC CONTINGENCY**: Budget 10% (₳6K) contingency, not ₳500. Explain allocation.
5. **CO-FUNDING PLAN**: Vietnamese tech sponsors, university in-kind venue, CF co-marketing - reduce Catalyst dependency.
6. **PRIZE COMPETITIVENESS**: Research Vietnamese hackathon prize benchmarks (VietBUIDL, Aptos). Justify ₳13K is sufficient.
7. **VALUE CALC SOURCES**: Cite studies for "developer lifetime value" ₳100K-200K claims. Otherwise remove.
8. **SUSTAINABILITY BEYOND MONTH 5**: Budget for 6 months post-event community operations (₳1-2K). Show commitment.

**RISK**: Proposal asks for maximum funding but provides minimum evidence. Community should demand risk-adjusted budget (₳40-50K) until team proves capability with Milestone 1-2 completion.

## Critical Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION)

- [ ] **NO TEAM CREDENTIALS SHOWN** - Every "[NAME TO BE PROVIDED]" must be filled with real people + LinkedIn profiles + track records. This alone tanks feasibility score.

- [ ] **NO VENUE CONFIRMATION** - Attach venue quote PDF (venue name, dates, capacity, cost, signed proposal/contract) or proposal is speculative.

- [ ] **NO UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS** - Get 1-2 signed letters from CS departments confirming student recruitment support. Email screenshot minimum.

- [ ] **NO ENTERPRISE COMMITMENTS** - Secure 1-2 enterprise LOIs committing to challenge tracks. Without this, "enterprise integration" is vaporware.

- [ ] **NO DETAILED BUDGET PUBLISHED** - "Budget spreadsheet: [TO BE PROVIDED]" is unacceptable. Publish Google Sheets with line items, make public.

- [ ] **PLACEHOLDER EPIDEMIC** - 20+ "[TO BE PROVIDED]" instances. Replace ALL with actual data or remove claims.

- [ ] **PROOF OF CARDANO EXPERTISE** - Technical lead must show Plutus/Aiken GitHub repos, teaching portfolio, certifications.

- [ ] **PROOF OF EVENT EXPERIENCE** - Lead organizer must show prior events: attendee count, photos, testimonials, venue contracts.

- [ ] **VIETNAMESE CARDANO COMMUNITY SIZE** - Disclose current Discord/Telegram member count. If <50, recalibrate entire proposal.

- [ ] **MARKETING PLAN DETAILS** - ₳5K marketing how? Which channels? CPM targets? Student club partnerships? Influencers identified?

## Overall Assessment

**Would I fund this proposal? NOT YET.**

### The Good
This proposal demonstrates **strong market research** and strategic thinking. Vietnam is genuinely underserved (zero Cardano hackathons vs $4.8M competitor investments), the regulatory timing is real (Jan 2026 blockchain law), and the market size (21.2M crypto users, 530K engineers) supports viability. The proposal's structure is comprehensive, KPIs are measurable, and the three-phase model (training + hackathon + incubation) addresses hackathon retention problems. Budget efficiency arguments (₳200-400/developer vs Berlin ₳1,666) are valid given Vietnam cost advantages.

### The Bad
This proposal is **60-70% complete at best**. Critical feasibility evidence is missing: zero team credentials shown (every field says "[NAME TO BE PROVIDED]"), no venue contract or quote attached, no university partnership letters, no enterprise LOIs, no budget spreadsheet published. The proposal reads like a well-researched TEMPLATE, not a submission-ready execution plan. For a ₳60K request (upper-bound of category), community expects bulletproof feasibility evidence. This provides speculation.

### The Ugly
**Execution risk is HIGH.** Recruiting 150-300 developers to an ecosystem with "scarce" Vietnamese presence assumes "build it and they will come." No existing community size disclosed (if Vietnamese Cardano Telegram has <50 members, entire plan collapses). Enterprise integration (core value prop) has ZERO confirmed partners. Ambitious timeline (Month 1: plan everything; Month 2-3: run 4-week bootcamp; Month 3: execute 300-person event) with unproven team is recipe for failure. Proposal optimism (50+ projects, ₳50K on-chain volume, 5-10 retained teams) lacks precedent in similar markets.

### Single Biggest Problem
**FEASIBILITY CREDIBILITY GAP**: Proposal asks community to trust ₳60K to anonymous team with no demonstrated Cardano expertise, no event track record, no confirmed venue, no partner commitments, no budget details. This is highest-risk proposal profile. Even excellent strategy cannot overcome "who are you and can you actually execute this?" question.

### Would Fund If...
1. Team fills in ALL credentials (names, LinkedIn, portfolios, prior events)
2. Venue quote + booking deposit receipt attached
3. 1-2 university partnership letters obtained
4. 1-2 enterprise LOIs secured
5. Detailed budget spreadsheet published
6. Vietnamese Cardano community size disclosed (realistic baseline)
7. Budget reduced to ₳40-50K (risk-adjusted for first-time team)

**If these fixed**: Would score 75-80/100 (fundable).
**Current state**: 62/100 (borderline reject).

---

## Recommended Actions (PRIORITY ORDER)

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Proposal-Killing if Not Fixed)
1. **Fill in all team member details** - Real names, LinkedIn URLs, Cardano portfolios, event experience. Replace every "[TO BE PROVIDED]" with actual data.
2. **Attach venue quote/contract** - PDF from named venue (Dreamplex, CirCO, university) showing 300-person capacity, 3-day availability, cost.
3. **Demonstrate Vietnamese Cardano community baseline** - Screenshot Discord/Telegram member count. If <50 members, recalibrate entire proposal to "community building from scratch" vs "growing existing community."
4. **Publish detailed budget** - Google Sheets with line items, vendor quotes, unit costs, quantities. Make public (view-only).

### Priority 2: HIGH (Major Feasibility/VFM Improvements)
5. **Secure 1-2 enterprise LOIs** - Signed letters from Vietnamese companies (FPT, VNPay, etc.) committing to provide challenge tracks or pilot opportunities.
6. **Get university partnership confirmations** - Email from 1-2 CS department chairs confirming student recruitment support, possible venue co-hosting.
7. **Narrow participant target** - Change "150-300" to "100-150." Show marketing plan (channels, budget, timeline) to achieve this.
8. **Reduce budget ask to ₳40-50K** - Risk-adjusted for first-time team. Show scaled version: 100-150 participants, ₳30K venue, ₳10K prizes.

### Priority 3: MEDIUM (Strengthens Proposal)
9. **Show Plutus/Aiken code examples** - Technical lead's GitHub repos demonstrating Cardano development capability.
10. **Provide proof of event experience** - Lead organizer's prior hackathon/conference: attendee count, venue contracts, testimonials.
11. **Add contingency budget** - Increase from ₳500 (0.8%) to ₳5-6K (10%). Justify allocation (weather, tech failures, ADA volatility beyond 80% hedge).
12. **Benchmark prize competitiveness** - Research Vietnamese hackathon prizes (VietBUIDL, Aptos). Show ₳13K ($6.5K) is sufficient to attract top talent.

### Priority 4: LOW (Polish/Optimization)
13. **Add co-funding sources** - Vietnamese tech company sponsors (₳5-10K), university in-kind venue support (₳3-5K savings).
14. **Demonstrate prior community engagement** - If team ran Vietnamese Cardano meetup, show photos/attendance. If not, explain cold-start strategy.
15. **Cite developer lifetime value sources** - "₳100K-200K per developer" claim needs academic study or industry report citation.
16. **Sustainability plan beyond Month 5** - Budget ₳1-2K for 6 months post-event Discord moderation, monthly meetups, content hosting.

---

## Final Recommendation

**CURRENT SCORE: 62/100 (Borderline Reject)**

**POTENTIAL SCORE IF FIXED: 75-80/100 (Fundable)**

This proposal has **strong strategic vision** (Vietnam market opportunity is real, timing is right, competitive gap is validated) but **weak execution credibility** (no team shown, no partners confirmed, no budget details, too many placeholders).

**Advice to proposer**: You have done excellent research. Now do the hard work: assemble the team, book the venue, secure partners, publish the budget. Return with evidence, not promises. Vietnamese Cardano ecosystem deserves this hackathon. But community deserves to fund teams who prove they can deliver.

**Advice to voters**: If you see this proposal with Priority 1-2 items fixed (team credentials, venue quote, budget spreadsheet, university confirmations), it's fundable at ₳40-50K. If proposer submits current draft unchanged, vote NO. Catalyst funds should reward preparation, not optimism.

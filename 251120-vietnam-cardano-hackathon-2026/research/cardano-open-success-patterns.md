# Cardano Open Category Success Patterns: Analysis Report

**Research Date**: November 20, 2025
**Scope**: Fund11-Fund14 Cardano Open & Ecosystem hackathon/event proposals
**Word Count**: ~150 lines

## Executive Summary

Winning Cardano hackathon proposals follow predictable patterns:

1. **Budget Realism**: ₳50K-₳200K total budgets with 60-70% venue/logistics focus, 15-20% prizes, 5-10% marketing
2. **Team Experience**: Demonstrated prior Catalyst success + institutional backing (universities, established NFT/blockchain orgs)
3. **Concrete Metrics**: Target 50-500+ developers; track: teams submitted, projects developed, participant satisfaction, post-event engagement
4. **Regional Focus + Global Appeal**: "Local problems solved with Cardano" resonates; East Africa education, Latin America developers, Berlin developer hubs
5. **Outcome Transparency**: Commit to close-out reports, post-event engagement tracking, open-source asset release

## Successful Proposal Case Studies

| Proposal | Fund | Budget (ADA) | Participants | Prize Pool | Status | Key Outcome |
|----------|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Berlin Hackathon (NMKR)** | F11 | ₳200,000 | 120+ developers | ₳30,000 | ✓ Funded | Venue/logistics 65% budget; venue dominates costs |
| **BUTC Vietnam Hackathon** | F13 | ₳68,000 | Developers + entrepreneurs + students | N/A specified | ✓ Funded (141 votes, ₳192M yes) | All 4 milestones completed; Vietnamese team |
| **East Africa Hackathon** | F12 | ₳50,000 | 77 students, 22 teams, 12 universities | ADA awards (top 3) | ✓ Funded | 2/3 milestones complete; education focus |
| **African Blockchain Championship** | F13 | ₳60,000 | ~1,000 developers (4 nations) | $8,000 USD | ✓ Funded | 4-5 month timeline; training + championship model |
| **NERDS LATAM Hackathons** | F12 | ₳80,000 | 500+ devs (3 cities) | N/A | ✗ Rejected | Over-budgeted for 3-city hybrid event |

## Budget Benchmarking (ADA-Denominated)

**Standard Allocations** (successful proposals):

- **Venue & Logistics**: 60-70% (₳30K-₳140K)
  - In-person venue rental, catering, equipment, travel support
  - Multi-city events require +30% premium

- **Prize Pool**: 15-20% (₳7.5K-₳40K)
  - Range: ADA awards (small hackathons) to $8K-$30K equivalents
  - Top 3-5 winners typical; hackathons favor multiple prize tiers

- **Marketing & Promotion**: 5-10% (₳2.5K-₳20K)
  - Campus posters, social media, local media, workshops
  - Regional hackathons need local-language marketing

- **Operations/Contingency**: 5-10% (₳2.5K-₳20K)
  - Team management, documentation, platform fees

**Total Range**: ₳50K (education-focused) to ₳200K (large in-person + multi-city)

## Impact Metrics & KPIs (From Successful Proposals)

**Universally Tracked**:

1. **Participation Volume**: Participant count, team count, university partnerships
2. **Project Outputs**: Number of projects submitted, avg team size, technical sophistication
3. **Satisfaction Metrics**: Participant feedback, skill development surveys, brand perception tracking
4. **Post-Event Engagement**: Projects continuing post-hackathon, participants joining dev communities, open-source contributions

**Cardano-Specific**:

- Teams integrating Cardano blockchain (vs. generic hackathon winners)
- On-chain activity from winning projects
- Long-term incubation support for promising teams

**Realistic Targets** (regional hackathon, 3-month execution):
- 50-500 participants (proportional to budget/region size)
- 10-100+ project submissions
- 3-5 winning projects
- 60%+ post-event participation in follow-up communities/support programs

## Common Failure Patterns to Avoid

1. **Budget Misalignment** (NERDS LATAM rejected):
   - Requested ₳80K for 3-city event = underestimated venue costs in multiple locations
   - **Lesson**: Multi-city requires separate budgeting; hybrid events expensive

2. **Weak Team Credentials**:
   - Failed proposals lacked demonstrated Catalyst experience or institutional backing
   - **Lesson**: Include team bios, prior event execution, partner institutional letters

3. **Vague Impact Metrics**:
   - "Increase Cardano adoption" without concrete KPIs = red flag
   - **Lesson**: Use quantified targets: "75 developers", "25 Cardano projects"

4. **Missing Transparency Commitments**:
   - No post-event reporting plans = skepticism
   - **Lesson**: Explicitly commit to: close-out report, community presentations, open-source repos

5. **Oversized Scope with Small Budget**:
   - Example: Targeting 1K developers with ₳50K (realistic max 200 at that budget)

## Vietnam Hackathon Recommendations

**Strategic Priorities**:

1. **Budget**: ₳70K-₳130K range
   - Vietnam venue costs + logistics likely ₳50K-₳90K (major cities)
   - Prize pool: ₳10K-₳20K (competitive for region)
   - Marketing: ₳5K-₳10K (multi-channel + campus outreach)

2. **Team**: Emphasize BUTC success (Fund13)
   - Partner with universities, local blockchain associations
   - Include prior hackathon organizers or Catalyst-experienced members

3. **Participant Targets**: 150-300 developers realistic
   - Based on East Africa (77) and Berlin (120+) at similar budgets
   - Vietnam tech ecosystem larger; adjust upward 2x vs. East Africa

4. **KPIs**:
   - 50+ quality project submissions
   - 2-3 teams continuing post-hackathon
   - Minimal ₳50K+ on-chain activity from winning projects in next 12 months

5. **Timeline**: 4-5 months standard
   - Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Marketing, team recruitment, sponsor outreach
   - Phase 2 (Month 2-3): Workshops, hackathon execution
   - Phase 3 (Month 4-5): Judging, post-event engagement, final report

6. **Differentiation**: "Education + Incubation"
   - Include pre-hackathon training (East Africa model)
   - Offer 3-month post-hackathon incubation for top projects (underexploited by past proposals)

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Specific BUTC Vietnam Hackathon outcomes**: Prize pool amount, exact participant count, and post-event follow-up not publicly available yet
2. **On-chain activity attribution**: How much of post-hackathon on-chain activity can be credited to hackathon participants vs. natural ecosystem growth?
3. **Long-term incubation success rates**: No published data on % of hackathon projects that receive follow-on funding or sustain development
4. **Regional cost variations**: ADA-denominated budgets; how venue costs scale across Tier-1 vs. Tier-2 Vietnamese cities?

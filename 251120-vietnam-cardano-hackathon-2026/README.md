# Vietnam Cardano Hackathon 2026 - Catalyst Fund15 Proposal

**Status**: Draft v1 Complete - Ready for User Review
**Category**: Cardano Open: Ecosystem
**Budget**: ₳60,000 ADA
**Timeline**: 5 months
**Created**: November 20, 2025

---

## Quick Overview

**What This Proposal Does**:
Vietnam's first Cardano-exclusive hackathon to onboard 150-300 developers, create 50+ open-source projects, and establish Southeast Asia ecosystem hub. Includes 4-week Vietnamese-language bootcamp, 3-day flagship event, and 3-month incubation program.

**Why It Matters**:
- Vietnam is #5 global crypto market (21.2M users) with ZERO Cardano hackathons
- Competitors invested $4.8M+ (VietBUIDL, Aptos) capturing developer mindshare
- New blockchain law (Jan 2026) creates rare regulatory window
- First-mover advantage before SEA market solidifies

**Value for Money**:
- ₳400 per developer (vs ₳1,666 Berlin funded proposal)
- ₳1,200 per project (vs ₳6,666 Berlin)
- 50-70% lower costs than Europe (Vietnam market advantage)
- 25-100x ROI potential over 2 years (ecosystem value)

## Potential Weaknesses & How to Address

### Weakness 1: Team Credentials Unknown
**Issue**: Proposal references team but no names/profiles provided yet
**Solution**: Fill in team section with verifiable LinkedIn profiles showing:
- Event organization experience (100+ attendee events)
- Cardano community involvement (Catalyst, SPO, development)
- Vietnamese market knowledge (based in Vietnam, corporate/university connections)

### Weakness 2: No Venue Commitment
**Issue**: Budget allocates ₳20K for venue but no confirmed booking
**Solution**: Obtain 2-3 quotes, show availability for target dates, attach PDFs
- Proves cost estimates realistic
- Reduces execution risk perception

### Weakness 3: Enterprise Partnerships Unproven
**Issue**: Claims "enterprise challenges" but no confirmed partners
**Solution**: Secure 2+ LOIs showing company interest
- Even non-binding letters demonstrate engagement
- Validates "real-world use cases" differentiation claim

### Weakness 4: First-Time Event Risk
**Issue**: No prior Cardano hackathon in Vietnam = unproven model
**Solution**: Reference BUTC Fund12 success (Vietnamese team, all milestones complete)
- Benchmark against funded proposals (Berlin, East Africa)
- Show risk mitigation strategies (backup venue, tiered prizes, hybrid option)

---

## Success Probability Assessment

**Current Status**: 50% complete (research done, proposal written, execution validation needed)

**If Team + Venue + LOIs Secured**:
- **Funding Probability**: 60-80% (based on alignment with Cardano Open criteria, competitive budget positioning, validated market opportunity)
- **Expected Score**: Impact 32/35, Feasibility 30/35, VFM 27/30 = 89/100 (high funding tier)

**If Submitted Without Validation**:
- **Funding Probability**: 20-40% (research strong but execution credibility weak)
- **Expected Score**: Impact 28/35, Feasibility 20/35, VFM 24/30 = 72/100 (borderline)

**Recommendation**: Address critical blockers (team, venue, LOIs) before submission. Strong proposal framework, needs execution proof to maximize funding success.

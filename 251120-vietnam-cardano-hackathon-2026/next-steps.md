### 5. Detailed Budget Breakdown & Validation
**Priority**: High (Fund15 requires itemized costs)

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create comprehensive budget spreadsheet with Vietnam market research

  **Budget Categories** (target ₳55K-₳60K):

  | Category | Items | ADA (estimated) | % |
  |----------|-------|----------------|---|
  | **Venue/Logistics** | 3-day rental, AV, WiFi, F&B, security | ₳35K-₳40K | 60-65% |
  | **Prize Pool** | 1st: ₳5K, 2nd: ₳3K, 3rd: ₳2K, Track winners: ₳1K x3 | ₳13K | 22% |
  | **Marketing** | Social media ads, influencer partnerships, posters, swag | ₳4K-₳5K | 7-8% |
  | **Operations** | Event platform (Devpost/custom), staff, tools | ₳3K-₳4K | 5-6% |
  | **Incubation** | Mentorship stipends, VC demo day, resources | ₳3K | 5% |

- [ ] Validate costs against Vietnam market data
  - Developer hourly rates: $20-$40 USD (vs global $50-$100)
  - Venue rental: $3K-$8K USD for 3-day tech event (tier-1 city)
  - Marketing: Vietnamese social media ad costs (Facebook, Zalo, YouTube)

- [ ] Compare to funded hackathon budgets (Berlin ₳200K, East Africa ₳50K, Vietnam BUTC ₳68K)
  - Justify higher cost vs East Africa (larger market, competitive parity)
  - Justify lower cost vs Berlin (Vietnam venue/labor costs 50-70% lower)

- [ ] Include "Value for Money" calculation
  - Cost per participant: ₳55K ÷ 200 = ₳275/developer (vs Berlin ₳1,666)
  - Cost per project submission: ₳55K ÷ 50 = ₳1,100 (vs typical ₳2K-₳4K)

**Deliverable**:
- Excel/Google Sheets budget with itemized line items
- Market research citations (salary surveys, venue quotes, ad platform rate cards)
- Value-for-money comparison table

**Timeline**: 1 week (concurrent with venue quotes)

---

### 6. Milestone Structure Planning
**Priority**: Medium (required for proposal but flexible during onboarding)

**Actions**:
- [ ] Draft 5 milestones (₳55K-₳60K requires 4 + close-out = 5 total)

  **Proposed Milestone Structure**:

  | # | Title | Deliverables | Duration | ADA |
  |---|-------|--------------|----------|-----|
  | 1 | Planning & Partnerships | Venue contract, enterprise LOIs, marketing launch | Month 1 | ₳8K |
  | 2 | Pre-Event Training | 4-week Vietnamese bootcamp, workshop recordings | Months 2-3 | ₳12K |
  | 3 | Hackathon Execution | 3-day event, 150+ participants, 50+ submissions | Month 3 | ₳25K |
  | 4 | Incubation Program | 5-10 teams mentored, VC demo day, Fund16 workshops | Months 4-5 | ₳8K |
  | 5 | Close-Out Report & Video | Impact metrics, community handoff, lessons learned | Month 5 | ₳5K |

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria per milestone (specific, measurable)
  - M1: Signed venue contract + 2 enterprise LOIs + 500 social media followers
  - M2: 4 recorded workshops + 50 bootcamp participants + Vietnamese Cardano docs
  - M3: 150+ registrations + 50+ submissions + event photos/videos + satisfaction survey
  - M4: 5 teams in incubation + demo day recording + 2 Fund16 proposal drafts
  - M5: Close-out report + video + GitHub repo of submissions + impact metrics dashboard

**Deliverable**:
- Milestone table (copy format from successful proposals)
- Evidence of completion descriptions per milestone

**Timeline**: 3 days (use template from research)

---

### 7. Risk Assessment & Contingency Planning
**Priority**: Medium (reviewers value transparency)

**Actions**:
- [ ] Document 5-7 key risks with mitigation strategies
  - Low participation → 8-week marketing, university partnerships, remote option
  - Budget overrun → Fixed-price contracts, tiered prize reduction clause
  - Venue cancellation → Backup venue identified, hybrid event pivot
  - Enterprise partners drop out → Generic community challenge tracks ready
  - Cardano market crash → ADA stablecoin hedge or USD-pegged contracts

- [ ] Develop "Partial Funding" scenario plan
  - If awarded <₳55K, which components scale down?
  - Minimum viable event: ₳40K (reduce venue scale, smaller prizes, no incubation)
  - Preferred budget: ₳55K-₳60K (full scope)

**Deliverable**:
- Risk matrix table (likelihood, impact, mitigation)
- Partial funding scenario table

**Timeline**: 2 days

---

### 8. Proposal Writing Preparation

**Actions**:
- [ ] Review Fund15 proposal submission form requirements
  - 60-char title limit: "Vietnam Cardano Hackathon 2026: Developer Ecosystem Launch"
  - 200-char problem statement (already drafted in ideation summary)
  - 200-char solution overview (already drafted)
  - 10,000-char solution description (expand ideation summary)

- [ ] Gather supporting documentation links

## Outstanding Questions for Clarification

### For Proposer Team
1. **Experience Verification**: Do team members have prior large-event organization experience? If yes, which events and what capacity?
2. **Vietnamese Market Knowledge**: Are you based in Vietnam? Connections to local blockchain community, universities, enterprises?
3. **Cardano Technical Depth**: Team's Plutus/Aiken development level? Teaching/workshop experience?
4. **Budget Authority**: Can you negotiate fixed-price contracts with venues in VND? Currency risk management plan?
5. **Timeline Constraints**: Any constraints on event dates (e.g., university exam periods, national holidays, monsoon season)?

### For Enterprise Partners (Once Engaged)
1. **Challenge Scope**: What real-world problems would you provide for hackathon tracks?
2. **Commitment Level**: In-kind sponsorship (venue, prizes) vs cash? Pilot program interest for winners?
3. **Judging Participation**: Can executive/tech leads serve on judging panel?

### For University Partners (Once Engaged)
1. **Recruitment Channel**: Email blasts to CS students? Blockchain club partnerships? Faculty endorsements?
2. **Co-Hosting**: Willing to provide venue at reduced cost? Logistical support?
3. **Credit/Internship**: Can participation count toward coursework or internship requirements?

## Success Criteria for Proposal Submission

**Minimum Viable Proposal** (Competitive but risky):
- Team with at least 1 member with verifiable event organization experience
- 1 venue quote documented in budget
- 1 enterprise partnership interest confirmation
- Realistic budget breakdown with Vietnam market research
- Clear milestone structure and acceptance criteria

**Strong Proposal** (High funding probability):
- Team with 2+ members with proven track records (events, Cardano development)
- 2-3 venue quotes with recommended selection
- 2+ enterprise partnership LOIs
- University recruitment confirmation
- Detailed budget with cost comparisons to funded proposals
- Risk assessment and contingency planning
- Evidence of community support (forum discussions, Discord engagement)

**Target**: Aim for "Strong Proposal" tier to maximize funding success in competitive Fund15.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Proceed with Proposal Writing**: ⚠️ **Conditional**

**Reasoning**:
- Market opportunity and competitive positioning are strong (validated by research)
- Budget and timeline realistic (benchmarked against successful proposals)
- Category alignment clear (Cardano Open: Ecosystem fits perfectly)
- Differentiation compelling (Cardano-exclusive, incubation, SEA expansion)

**But**:
- Team credentials not yet verified (highest risk to feasibility score)
- No venue or enterprise commitments (reduces execution credibility)
- Budget lacks itemized validation (weakens value-for-money argument)

**Action**: Complete Week 1-2 next steps before writing full proposal. If team/venue/LOIs secured within 2 weeks, proceed to proposal writing. If not, consider deferring to Fund16 with stronger preparation.

**Alternative Path**: If timeline too tight for Fund15, use this research to prepare superior Fund16 proposal with:
- Fully assembled team with proven track record
- Venue contracts signed (using personal/organizational funds as pre-investment)
- Enterprise partnerships formalized
- Pilot pre-event workshop to demonstrate community traction
